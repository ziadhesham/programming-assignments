## Description

Implementation of an error-detection mechanism using the standard CRC algorithm.

Features:
- [x] The Generator Program:
	- Reads from standard input a line of ASCII text containing an m-bit message consisting of a string of 0s and 1s. The second line is the k-bits polynomial, also in ASCII. It outputs to standard output a line of ASCII text with (m+k) 0s and 1s representing the message to be transmitted. Then it outputs the polynomial, just as it read it in.
- [x] The Verifier program:
	- reads in the output of the generator program and outputs a message indicating whether it is correct or not.
- [x] The Alter program:
	- inverts 1 bit on the first line depending on its argument (the bit number counting the leftmost bit as 1) but copies the rest of the two lines correctly.
